README

This file contains information pertaining to the WifiDirect Application to be run on the Nexus 7.

I have started a new project in eclipse and will be pushing this project to GitHub.
The link for the repo is:  https://github.com/drewby08/cse4471.git

Within the project is a zip file containing the correct Nexus 7 debugging drivers.  I had to install these locally in order to launch the project on my Nexus 7 from eclipse.
